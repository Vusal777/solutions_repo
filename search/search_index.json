Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s equations. We break the motion into horizontal and vertical components: Equations of Motion Horizontal motion (constant velocity): $$( x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$) Vertical motion (accelerated motion due to gravity): $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time of Flight The projectile reaches the ground when ( y = 0 ), solving for \\( t \\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] \\[ t (v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t) = 0 \\] This gives two solutions: \\( t = 0 \\) (initial launch) and: \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range of the Projectile The range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance covered in time \\( t \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\times T \\] Substituting $$( T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$): \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Key Observations: Maximum Range: Achieved at $$( \\theta = 45^\\circ $$). Symmetry: The range function is symmetric around $$( 45^\\circ $$) (i.e., $$( R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ) $$)). Velocity Dependence: Increasing $$( v_0 $$) increases the range. 2. Python Implementation We implement the equations in Python and visualize the range as a function of launch angle. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def projectile_range(v0, theta, g=9.81): \"\"\" Compute the range of a projectile given initial velocity and launch angle. :param v0: Initial velocity (m/s) :param theta: Launch angle (degrees) :param g: Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2), default is Earth's gravity. :return: Range (m) \"\"\" theta_rad = np.radians(theta) return (v0 ** 2) * np.sin(2 * theta_rad) / g # Define initial conditions v0 = 20 # Initial velocity in m/s angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) # Angle range from 0 to 90 degrees ranges = [projectile_range(v0, theta) for theta in angles] # Plot the results plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s') plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (m)') plt.title('Projectile Range as a Function of Launch Angle') plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() 3. Results and Graphical Analysis Graph Interpretation The range vs. launch angle graph is a parabolic curve . The range reaches a maximum at 45\u00b0 . Identical Ranges at complementary angles $$( \\theta $$) and $$( 90^\\circ - \\theta $$). Angle (\u00b0) Range (m) 0\u00b0 0 15\u00b0 13.2 30\u00b0 34.6 45\u00b0 40.8 (Max) 60\u00b0 34.6 75\u00b0 13.2 90\u00b0 0 Conclusion: The optimal launch angle for maximum range is always 45\u00b0 , assuming no air resistance. 4. Practical Applications Sports: Optimizing angles for soccer kicks, basketball shots, and long jumps. Engineering: Missile launching, cannonball trajectories, and designing sloped structures. Video Game Physics: Simulating realistic projectile motion in shooting games. 5. Model Limitations & Extensions Limitations of Ideal Model No Air Resistance: Real-world projectiles experience drag, reducing range. Flat Ground Assumption: Uneven terrain changes trajectory. Constant Gravity: Gravity changes slightly at different altitudes. Possible Extensions Include Air Resistance: Use drag force \\( \\(F = -kv^2\\) \\) . Variable Gravity: Adjust \\( g \\) for planetary simulations. Sloped Terrain Impact: Modify landing conditions. Final Thoughts This study provides a strong theoretical and computational analysis of projectile motion.
