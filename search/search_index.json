Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s equations.

Theoretical Foundation The forced damped pendulum is governed by the nonlinear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + c \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\({ \\theta }\\) is the angular displacement, - b is the damping coefficient, - c represents the gravitational restoring force ( \\( <b> g/L </b> \\) ), - A is the amplitude of the external driving force, - \u03c9 is the driving frequency. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\({ \\theta \\approx \\sin \\theta }\\) ), the equation reduces to a driven damped harmonic oscillator : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + c \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] which has a well-known analytical solution for periodic motion.

Phase Space Analysis The (\u03b8, \u03c9) phase space plot shows: - Simple periodic motion (closed loops) for weak forcing. - Chaotic motion (random patterns) for high driving amplitudes. 4. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum models various real-world systems: - Energy Harvesting: Vibration-based energy harvesting devices. - Mechanical Systems: Suspension bridges under periodic forces (e.g., Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse). - Electrical Circuits: Analogous to driven RLC circuits in electronics. 5.
